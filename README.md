# GGStat

Uses direct memory reads from the GuiltyGearXrd process to access data such as rounds won and played HP.

Data is saved into a local database file.

Running the executable will start the application, which will wait for a Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2 process to start. Upon starting it will begin to track player stats and save them locally.
